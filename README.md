# RCodingSample

This is a shortened sample of one of my 10+ projects that I worked on over the course of a 10 month research internship at the University of Pennsylvania Autism Spectrum Program of Excellence. Advised by a research coordinator, I finished my main summer project on the impacts of NRXN1 genomic variants and its correlation with autism spectrum disorder. Throughout high school senior year, I worked on a variety of projects such as analyzing the effects of sleep mediciation and psychiatric disorders on sleep-wake traits for people on the autism spectrum.   

This coding sample comes from one of my fall projects focused on the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ), a questionnaire that examines sensory sensitivity across various modalities such as visual and tactile. In this sample, I manipulated the dataframe, "regressed out" several variables from the dataframe (removing the effects of age, age squared, and sex), and created visualizations to present to the lab.
